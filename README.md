Section 02

For this assignment, there are 9 files: GameOfLife.h, GameOfLife.cpp, ClassicMode.h, ClassicMode.cpp, DonutMode.h, DonutMode.cpp, MirrorMode.h, MirrorMode.cpp, and main.cpp. There are also 4 text files, sample.txt which has the example board from the instructions, and classic.txt, donut.txt, and mirror.txt which holds the outputs of each board using sample.txt.

This program uses a Makefile to compile, type make all in your terminal and ./assignment2 to run.

This program runs completely, with all the modes and user inputs and correct output depending on what the user chooses. 

I worked alone on this assignment, all code used was purely my own with help from office hours and the sources I used which are listed below:
